<p>Hi, my name is Sam Marder and I'm a freshman studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Most of my experience with has been in backend development and testing with Java and Python I've also messed around with some other languages including Ruby, C++, Javascript, and MySQL. When I'm not busy with school work, I run a Linux email server and play the cello.</p>

<p>Most recently, I was fascinated by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE">POODLE vulnerability affecting SSLv3</a>. As I run a server that accepts (and sometimes enforces) secure connections, I wanted to make sure that I had completely disabled SSLv3 across all services on my server. Unable to find a utility that would comprehensively test a system for the presence of SSLv3, I decided to <a href="https://github.com/supersam654/Poodle-Checker">make one myself</a>. The end result was a nifty little Python script that checks a wide variety of common ports to see if they accept connections over SSLv3. It's available in <a href="https://github.com/supersam654">my GitHub</a> under the MIT License.</p>

<p>Previously, I also made a <a href="https://github.com/supersam654/Tweetalyzer">Twitter Crawler</a>. Using the Twitter Streaming API, I was able to create a feed of tweets coming out of different cities around the world. Then I tallied up all of the different hashtags I could find and displayed them in a simple JavaScript chart. Like all of my projects, it's still a work in progress.</p>
